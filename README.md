# 3D Physics Engine

This project is a lightweight and modular 3D physics engine designed for educational purposes. It implements core functionalities required for simulating physical systems in three-dimensional space.

## Features
- Custom vector math library (`MyVector3`) for 3D computations.
- Support for vector arithmetic, normalization, cross products, and dot products.
- Modular design, allowing for easy expansion and integration into other projects.
- Written entirely in C++ for performance and portability.

## Documentation
The following documentation files are available in the `docs/` directory:
- [MyVector3 Documentation](./docs/MATH_FUNCTIONS.md): Detailed explanation of the `MyVector3` class.
- Additional documentation files will be included as more features are developed.



## Notes
- The engine is designed for learning and experimentation, and is not optimized for production use.
